In this article, we will look at how I created my voice assistant device to send commands to Home Assistant using Wake Word.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />  


## Requirements

1.  **Home Assistant** up and running.  
    You can check [this](https://smarthomecircle.com/how-to-connect-wifi-to-home-assistant-on-startup) link to see how you can install it for the first time
2.  **ESPHome** is setup and running  
    In case you have not set it up, you can look at it [here](https://smarthomecircle.com/esp32-esp8266-esphome-with-home-assistant).
    <br/>
3. **ESP32 Dev Board**

To set up voice assistant, we would need three components to create the voice assist pipeline in Home Assistant.

1.  **Whisper**: For speech-to-text
2.  **Piper**: For text-to-speech
3.  **OpenWakeWord**: For invoking the Assist Pipeline

Now, I have set up these components using Home Assistant Addons in the video below.
<div className="md:w-1/2"> 
                      <iframe
                        id="video"
                        className="w-full aspect-video"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4V2JqCmk7M"
                        frameBorder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowFullScreen
                      ></iframe>
</div>
You will get to see how to set up the following components that are required

1.  **Whisper** Addon
2.  **Piper** Addon
3.  **OpenWakeWord** Addon
4.  And finally the entire **Voice Assist** pipeline.

So make sure to watch it and set up the **Voice Assist** pipeline

## Voice Assistant Device 3D Model

The 3D model is uploaded [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6329167). You can download the STL file from there. 

Now we will look at how we can prepare our ESP32 with a microphone and 3-watt speakers.

## Circuit Diagram for Creating Voice Assistant Device With ESP32

Here is the circuit diagram for connecting the ESP32 with INMP441 Microphone, MAX98357A Audio Amplifier, and WS2812B LED Strip.

![voice-assistant-circuit-diagram.webp](/static/images/2023/voice-assistant-device-with-wake-word/voice-assistant-circuit-diagram.webp)

Here is the pin mapping table

| ESP32       | INMP441 Microphone | Speaker | W2812B LED Strip | 
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |  ---------- |
| Vin (5v)    |             | Vin      |  5v pin |
| GND         |             | Gnd  |  GND |
| GPIO 27     |             | DIN  | |
| GPIO 26     |   WS        | LRC  | |
| GPIO 25     |   SCK       | BCLK | |
| GPIO 33     |   SD        |      | |
| 3v3         |   VDD       |      | |
| GND         |  GND & L/R  |      | |
| GPIO 32     |             |      |  DIN |

Let's look at the code we need to install in the ESP32

## ESPHome YAML Code For Voice Assistant
If you are new to how to install YAML code on an ESP32 using ESPhome then you can follow this guide, wherein I have explained how you can install code on an ESP32.
Now here is the code that you will have to add after creating a device in ESPHome

```yaml
