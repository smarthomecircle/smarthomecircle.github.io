In this article, we will explore how we can share files with Home Assistant OS.

We will make use of **Samba Share** to allow Home Assistant folders to be accessed as network volumes from another computer.

## Requirements

1.  Home Assistant OS setup and running.  
    You can check [this](https://smarthomecircle.com/how-to-connect-wifi-to-home-assistant-on-startup) link to see how you can install it for the first time

**Note**: **Samba Share** only works with Home Assistant OS. For Home Assistant docker containers, you can directly access the folders using mounted volumes.

## Install and Setup Samba Share

To install Samba Share, we need to install the Samba Share addon in Home Assistant OS.


**Step 1**: Go to **Home Assistant** Settings in the left panel

**Step 2**: Click on **Addons**

**Step 3**: Click on **Addon Store** in the bottom right-hand corner.

**Step 4**: Search for **Samba Share** and select it

**Step 5**: Click on the **Configuration** tab

**Step 6**: set the username and password ( this will be used to access the shared volumes from another computer)

**Step 7**: Set the allowed hosts depending on the IP address range of your home network.  
For example, if your Home Assistant is connected to your Wifi with the IP address `192.168.0.130`, you can set the allowed host as `192.168.0.0/16`.

This will allow all devices from your Wifi network to access the shared drive.

You can always check your IP address range in your home network using [https://cidr.xyz](https://cidr.xyz).

**Step 8**: Save the settings and start the addon from the info tab.
