In this video/article I’m sharing my experience with the **Radxa Cubie A5E**—a tiny SBC that surprised me with how much it packs into such a small footprint, and how it stacks up against boards like the Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi 5.

## My setup & first impressions (OS situation)

I started with [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/radxa-cubie-a5e/). It booted fine over LAN, but at the time there were a couple of missing pieces for my testing: **no HDMI output** and **no exposed temperature sensors**, which I needed for thermal checks. On the plus side, it shipped with a **Linux 6.16** kernel, so I’m optimistic about where community support is heading.

Next I tried [**Radxa’s own Linux image**](https://docs.radxa.com/en/cubie/a5e/download) (they also offer Android). The image was labeled **Debian Bullseye**, but the system actually identified itself as **Debian 13 “Trixie”** during my checks—which was **pre-release** at the time. Despite that, it **worked surprisingly well** and gave me the sensors and display I needed.

----------

## Thermals Performance

With **no heatsink**, the A5E idled around **~70 °C**. On this board the sensors present as two groups: **`cpul`** (the 1.4 GHz cluster) and **`cpub`** (the 1.8 GHz cluster).

Since I planned to run benchmarks, I installed the **metal case** (with a thermal pad). Assembly took a minute—remove the side struts, slide the board in, refit the I/O side panels (Wi-Fi antenna + LAN line up nicely), then screw it all back together.

**Result:** idle temps **dropped to ~43 °C**—about a **40% reduction**—and with this, I continued my tests.

----------

## Benchmarks Results

> All tests were run on the 4 GB variant, fresh boot, same desk ambient, desktop still running in the background as it came built in the debian Image, accessed via SSH.

### 1) CPU: Sysbench Test (Calculates prime numbers upto 20,000 for every 10k requests)

-   **Total time:** ~**39 s**
    
-   **Throughput:** ~**2,500 events/s**
    
-   **Peak temp:** ~**58 °C** (with the case)
    
A touch **slower than Raspberry Pi 4** in this specific test (by ~3 s), but close.

</p>

### 2) Memory Tests

-   **MEMCPY:** ~**2,900 MiB/s**
    
-   **Block Copy (1 KiB):** ~**4,000 MiB/s**
    
**Better than Raspberry Pi 4** in my runs. The Raspberry Pi 5 and Cubie A5E both have a **32-bit memory bus**, but Pi 5’s **LPDDR4X** tends to push higher transfers than **LPDDR4** that the A5E and Pi 4 has.

### 3) Geekbench (CPU)

-   **Single-core:** **241**
    
-   **Multi-core:** **1005**
    
-   **Power draw:** ~**2 W** idle; up to **~6 W** during multi-core phases
    
-   **Thermals:** peaked around **~75 °C** ( with the case )

The Cubie A5E did perform better than the Raspberry Pi 4 in the multicore performance test.

</p>
    

----------

## Storage & networking

-   **NVMe over M.2 M-key (PCIe Gen2 x1):** `lspci` confirmed **Gen2 x1**; `hdparm` reads landed around **~366 MB/s**, which is right in line with **PCIe 2.0 x1** limits.
    
-   **Dual Gigabit Ethernet:** in repeated iperf runs, **one port consistently tested a bit slower** than the other. I am not sure why.

## Whisper on Home Assistant (Docker)

One of my standard checks: **Home Assistant + Whisper + Piper** in Docker.  
With **Whisper small-int8**, speech-to-text took about **~11 seconds** for my sample—**faster than my Raspberry Pi 4** with the same model. For voice-friendly HA automations at the edge, that’s a nice win at this size and power.

## So… should you get one?

If you want a **low-power, compact box** with **Wi-Fi 6**, **two GbE ports**, and **NVMe**, the **Cubie A5E** is great for things like:

-   **Pi-hole / AdGuard Home**
    
-   **Home Assistant** (light-to-moderate setups)
    
-   **DIY routers / multi-NIC tinkering**
    

Just remember:
    
-   Passive cooling with the **metal case** is _highly_ recommended.
    
-   PCIe is **Gen2 x1**—perfectly fine for snappy apps and Docker volumes, but not a storage monster.
    
Finally I would be still monitoring the Armbian community build for a more stable release.
