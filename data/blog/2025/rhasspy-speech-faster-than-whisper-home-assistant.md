If you‚Äôve been exploring **local voice assistants with Home Assistant**, you‚Äôve probably come across the powerful but resource-heavy **Whisper** speech-to-text engine. I‚Äôve been down that road myself ‚Äî starting with an [**ESP32 and OpenWakeWord**](https://smarthomecircle.com/created-voice-assistant-esp32-with-wake-word-in-home-assistant), moving to an [**ESP32-S3 with on-device wake word detection**](https://smarthomecircle.com/How-I-created-my-voice-assistant-with-on-device-wake-word-using-home-assistant), and eventually trying out the [**Voice Assistant Preview Edition**](https://youtu.be/4PP14HErHl4) from Home Assistant.

While these setups varied, one thing stayed constant: **Whisper was always the speech-to-text engine**. And while it‚Äôs accurate, it can be slow and demanding ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre running Home Assistant on a **Raspberry Pi**.

## The Whisper Challenge: Accuracy vs Speed

Whisper comes in different models:
- **Small models**: Faster but less accurate.
- **Large models**: More accurate, but slower and more resource-intensive.

For reference, I‚Äôve been using the **medium-int-8 model**, which:
- Converts speech to text in about **3 seconds** on my mini PC.
- Has roughly **90% accuracy**.

But most of us start with a **Raspberry Pi**, and for that hardware, Whisper‚Äôs heavier models can feel painfully slow. The question is ‚Äî do you really need to **upgrade to a mini PC** for good voice control?  
**The answer: not necessarily.**

## Meet the Rhasspy Speech

The **Rhasspy Speech** Addon is a lightweight, fast alternative to Whisper. It‚Äôs available directly from the **Home Assistant Add-on Store**.

#### How It Works
Instead of transcribing anything you say, Rhasspy matches your commands to a set of **pre-trained phrases**. For example:
- ‚ÄúTurn on the light.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the time?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the temperature in the bedroom?‚Äù

![whisper-performance](/static/images/2025/rhasspy-speech/rhasspy-ui.webp)

The Rhasspy Speech addon lets you access the Intents section to view all devices integrated with your Home Assistant. Using the UI, you can Train it with common device commands, add your own custom sentences using a simple YAML format. Then you can integrate the addon via the Wyoming integration so your voice assistant pipeline can start using Rhasspy for speech-to-text.

## Lightning-Fast Performance on Raspberry Pi

When I tested Rhasspy, it recognized my speech in **under 1 second** ‚Äî on a **Raspberry Pi 4**.  
That‚Äôs huge for Pi users who don‚Äôt want to invest in a mini PC.

## My 15-Day Experience

Over the past two weeks of daily use, Rhasspy Speech has consistently impressed me with its near-instant recognition speed. Commands are processed in **under a second**, which makes interacting with my smart home feel natural and fluid. In terms of **accuracy**, I‚Äôve observed an average of **around 80%**, which is slightly lower than Whisper‚Äôs ~90% detection rate. However, in real-world use, the snappy responsiveness often outweighed the occasional misinterpretation. 

As a result, I‚Äôve completely switched to using Rhasspy Speech as my primary speech-to-text engine for everyday Home Assistant control, finding it far more enjoyable for quick and common voice commands.

## When Rhasspy Might Fall Short

Rhasspy works brilliantly for everyday, **common voice commands**, but it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution. If you‚Äôre using **AI agents** and want to ask open-ended questions or have more natural conversations, you might find it not useful. The same goes for very **customized phrasing** ‚Äî unless you‚Äôve taken the time to train Rhasspy with those exact sentences, it may not always understand what you mean.

## Installation and Setup

### On Home Assistant OS

Getting started is straightforward ‚Äî just head to the **Add-on Store**, search for **Rhasspy Speech**, and install it. Once it‚Äôs running, you can use the built-in UI to train the addon with your common sentences and custom commands.

### On Home Assistant Container

If you‚Äôre running Home Assistant in a container, you can still use Rhasspy Speech by running it as a **Docker container**. In this setup, there‚Äôs no training UI ‚Äî instead, Rhasspy automatically trains itself when it starts, using the devices and aliases already in your Home Assistant setup. The only catch is that if you add or rename devices, you‚Äôll need to restart the container so it can pick up the changes.

Here is the docker compose definition
```yaml
services:
  wyoming-speech-to-phrase:
    image: rhasspy/wyoming-speech-to-phrase
    container_name: wyoming-speech-to-phrase
    ports:
      - "10300:10300"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models
      - ./train:/train
    command: >
      --hass-websocket-uri ws://192.168.0.43:8123/api/websocket
      --hass-token <replace this with your Home Assistant Token>
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

## Why Rhasspy is Worth a Try

Rhasspy Speech is a quick, **lightweight** alternative to Whisper for Home Assistant voice control. If you‚Äôre on a **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5**, it‚Äôs an easy way to keep things fast and responsive without spending money on a more powerful PC.
