## What is KVM Over IP?

KVM stands for **Keyboard, Video, and Mouse**, and KVM-over-IP means you can control a computer‚Äôs input and output remotely‚Äîeven before the operating system boots. This is critical for situations where you need to troubleshoot a system that won‚Äôt boot, reinstall an OS, or access the BIOS/UEFI settings.

Unlike traditional remote desktop tools like TeamViewer or RDP, a **KVM-over-IP solution like the Comet** works **independently of the OS** and gives you **hardware-level control** of the machine.

Inside the Comet‚Äôs packaging, you‚Äôll find the KVM device itself, a USB-C to USB-C cable for connecting to the host system, an HDMI cable for video input, and an Ethernet cable for network connectivity. While the unit does not come with a power adapter, it can be powered with any standard 5V/2A USB-C power supply.

The device is housed in a robust metal enclosure and feels solid in hand. Its minimal yet functional design includes ports for HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet, USB 2.0, and a reset button.

2. **Plug the HDMI cable** from your target machine (like a mini PC or server) into the HDMI-IN port on the Comet.
3. **Connect the USB-C cable** from your target machine to the USB-C port on the Comet. This enables keyboard and mouse control.
4. **Power the Comet** using a USB-C charger (5V/2A recommended).

Once powered, the LED indicators will guide you through the device status:
- A **solid blue light** indicates power.

## ATX Power Control Accessory

One of the standout accessories for the Comet is the optional **[ATX power control board](https://store-eu.gl-inet.com/products/atx-board)**. This add-on allows you to **remotely control power and reset functions** on the target machine‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs fully powered off.

The ATX board connects to your computer‚Äôs motherboard via standard front-panel header pins and plugs into the Comet via USB-C. Once installed, you can:
- Power the machine on or off remotely
- Trigger a hardware reset
- Monitor power and HDD LEDs

This level of control is especially valuable for IT admins managing servers in remote locations, or for home lab enthusiasts who want full control without physically accessing the hardware.
