If you're into DIY tech setups, compact home servers, or SBC (Single Board Computer) projects, this custom-built **DIY 10-inch rack** is exactly what you need. In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through how I designed and assembled my own modular rack using **2020 T-slot aluminium extrusion rails**, standard M5 hardware, and some clever 3D-printed accessories.

Whether you‚Äôre looking to mount Raspberry Pi boards, Jetson devices, small switches, or custom carrier boards, this rack is built for flexibility and expansion. Plus, I‚Äôve included a full **list of components with shopping links**, 3D print files, and practical insights from my build process.

----------

## üîß **Rack Design Goals & Dimensions**

I needed a compact rack with the following specifications:

-   **Height:** 50 cm
-   **Depth:** 20 cm
-   **Width:** Suitable for 10-inch rack mount modules
    

The key material used was **2020 aluminium extrusion profiles**, commonly found in 3D printers. I used different lengths to build a rectangular frame and connected them using **L-shaped corner brackets**. Here's how the pieces came together:

-   **500mm rails (4 pcs)** ‚Äì For vertical supports
-   **250mm rails (4 pcs)** ‚Äì For rack depth
-   **200mm rails (4 pcs)** ‚Äì For rack width (front and back frames)

## üíª **Mounted Devices on the Rack**

Once the frame was ready, I started mounting my devices using custom 3D-printed 10-inch rack mounts:

### 1. **GLiNet Slate 7 Travel Router**

GLiNet Slate 7 is a compact WiFi 7 travel router with dual 2.5GbE ports, USB 3.0, and USB-C PD input.
It features a built-in touchscreen for quick access to VPN, TOR, WiFi settings, and device stats.
Powered by a 1.1GHz quad-core Qualcomm CPU, it includes 1GB RAM, 512MB flash, and OpenWRT preinstalled.
With speeds up to 1.3Gbps over WiFi and power use around 5W, it‚Äôs ideal for travel networking.
At $150, it delivers strong value with NAS support, advanced features, and worldwide adapters included.
    

### 2. **Raspberry Pi 5 & Orange Pi 5 Max**

The Raspberry Pi 5 features a 2.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 CPU with up to 8GB RAM.
It includes dual 4K HDMI outputs, PCIe support, USB 3.0, and a microSD card slot.
Now with a dedicated power button and real-time clock, it improves usability.
The new RP1 I/O chip delivers faster USB, camera, and networking performance.
Ideal for DIY projects, media centers, and light desktop tasks at an affordable price.
    

### 3. **Jet KVM Interface**

The JetKVM is a compact, open-source KVM-over-IP device that allows full remote control of a computer‚Äîeven when it's powered off, locked, or unresponsive. It features HDMI, USB, and Ethernet connectivity, supporting functions like Wake-on-LAN, virtual USB mounting, and remote OS installation. Housed in a sturdy die-cast zinc alloy body, it‚Äôs powered by a Rockchip CPU with hardware H.264/HEVC encoding for smooth, low-latency (~30‚Äì100‚ÄØms) streaming. Its web-based interface offers real-time performance stats and flexible access options, including local or cloud-based control. Priced from around $69, it‚Äôs OTA-updatable and promises future open-source support, though it currently lacks built-in Wi-Fi and audio passthrough.
    

### 4. **Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Switch**

-   Temporary network hub
    
-   Future upgrade planned: **Ubiquiti 2.5 Gbps Flex Switch**
    

### 5. **Radxa Rock 5T **

The Radxa Rock 5T is a powerful SBC powered by the RK3588 octa-core processor with 6 TOPS AI performance.
It supports up to 4 displays (including 8K60 HDMI and USB-C), dual 2.5GbE, HDMI input, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2. With LPDDR5 RAM, dual PCIe NVMe slots, and M.2 for 4G modules, it‚Äôs ideal for edge AI, media, or server use. Benchmark tests show strong multicore performance and fast NVMe and memory speeds.
It can run Home Assistant, NAS setups, and AI workloads, making it great for home labs and DIY projects.
    

### 6. **LattePanda Mu Lite Carrier Board**

The LattePanda‚ÄØMu Lite Carrier Board, paired with the Intel‚ÄØN100-equipped Mu module, transforms the tiny 60√ó70‚ÄØmm x86 board into a compact yet powerful top-tier mini PC reference design. It bridges essential I/O‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØHDMI 2.0 output, USB‚ÄØ3.2 Gen‚ÄØ2, Gigabit Ethernet, PCIe‚ÄØ3.0‚ÄØx4 slot (with 12‚ÄØV input), and dual M.2 slots for NVMe storage or wireless modules. Powered via USB‚ÄëC (up to 15‚ÄØV) or a 12‚Äì20‚ÄØV DC jack, it supports passive or active cooling modes and runs Windows or Linux seamlessly. The Intel‚ÄØN100 chip delivers roughly twice the CPU and 10‚Äì30√ó GPU performance compared to Raspberry Pi‚ÄØ5, all within a highly customizable, open-source carrier board platform. Perfect for DIY NAS, edge computing, mini servers, or custom embedded designs‚Äîthis board is an ideal x86 foundation for maker and home-lab projects.
