## Connectivity Features for Travelers
![router ports](/static/images/2025/glinet-slate-7-travel-router/3-lan.jpg)

The Slate 7 is engineered with **travel flexibility in mind**. You can switch between **multiple WAN modes** including Ethernet, repeater, USB tethering, or even using a cellular modem via USB for internet access — ideal for travelers navigating various network conditions.

The **dual 2.5 GbE ports** allow high-speed wired networking — significantly faster than traditional gigabit ports — making the device suitable for home lab setups or remote workstations with heavy data needs. Combined with a **USB 3.0 port**, you can easily host shared drives or connect your phone for tethered internet.

## Touchscreen Interface & VPN Management

The built-in **touchscreen interface** is one of Slate 7’s standout features, giving users quick access to common functions without logging into the web UI. You can scan a **QR code to connect**, monitor network speed live, toggle **VPN (OpenVPN/WireGuard)**, or enable **Tor routing** in a few taps.

Swiping through the touchscreen UI reveals useful info like CPU/RAM stats, connected devices, and Wi-Fi SSID management. It's especially handy when you're in transit or managing networks without a laptop or mobile device nearby.

## Real-World Performance

In real-world testing, Slate 7 delivers outstanding performance thanks to **Wi-Fi 7 and MLO (Multi-Link Operation)**. Using **80 MHz channels**, users can see wireless speeds close to **820 Mbps** — already impressive. But switching to **160 MHz**, speeds climb to **1.3 Gbps**, which is fantastic for streaming, remote backups, or large file transfers.

All this performance comes without major power draw — the device consumes only **4–5 watts** during heavy operation, making it ideal for use with **power banks or USB PD-compatible solar stations**.

## Security & Privacy Features

Security is built in at every level. The Slate 7 comes preloaded with **OpenVPN and WireGuard clients**, and supports over **30 major VPN providers** like NordVPN, Surfshark, and Private Internet Access. You can also run your own **VPN server** for secure remote access to home networks.

For those serious about privacy, the device includes **AdGuard Home DNS**, supports **DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS**, **IPv6 firewalls**, **WPA3 encryption**, and gives you full access to **OpenWrt's plugin ecosystem** for advanced features like bandwidth metering, custom firewalls, VLANs, and more.

## Use Cases & Scenarios

**Remote Work:** Whether you're working from an Airbnb, hotel, or airport lounge, Slate 7 provides a secure and fast network hub. Connect multiple devices to your private network and tunnel everything through VPN or Tor.

**Gaming & Streaming:** Thanks to Wi-Fi 7 and 2.5GbE, latency is minimized, making it suitable for online gaming and 4K content streaming. Great for Steam Deck, Xbox Cloud, or Plex users on the go.

**Portable NAS:** Plug in a USB stick or SSD to turn the router into a temporary NAS. Perfect for photographers and video editors wanting to share files between devices while off-site.

**Travel Network Hub:** The Slate 7 is your best friend in hotels with bad Wi-Fi. Connect once to public Wi-Fi via repeater mode, then create a private, secured LAN for all your devices — saving time and enhancing privacy.

## Pricing & Verdict

- **MSRP**: USD 149.90 (includes adapters for US/EU/UK/AU regions)
- **Pros**: Wi-Fi 7, dual 2.5GbE, portable, touchscreen, USB 3.0, OpenWrt, multi-WAN
- **Cons**: No built-in battery or 6 GHz band, but not a dealbreaker

At under $150, the GL.iNet Slate 7 is a **compelling value** — blending advanced networking features, premium performance, and excellent portability in a rugged travel-ready package.
