**Hi there,**

I’m **Amrut**, and if you’re passionate about **home automation, smart homes, and home labs**, you’re in the right place! I love exploring the latest technologies and **sharing my setups and experiences** with a growing audience.

I primarily use **Home Assistant** to automate and monitor my home with **various sensors and complex automation scenarios**. Through my content, I showcase how smart technology can practicaly improve **efficiency, security, and daily convenience**.

Beyond home automation, I showcase my **home lab setups**, including **custom servers, NAS solutions, and single-board computers** like Raspberry Pi and Radxa SBCs. I love testing these systems, **benchmarking performance, analyzing power efficiency, and sharing my findings** so others can make informed decisions about their own setups.

Whether you’re just starting your **smart home journey** or looking for **advanced automation solutions**, I strive to provide valuable insights, practical guides, and real-world demonstrations to help you along the way.
